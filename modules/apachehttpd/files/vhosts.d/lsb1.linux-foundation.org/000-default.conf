	# 4 possible values: All, SSLv2, SSLv3, TLSv1. Allow TLS only:
	SSLProtocol all -SSLv2 -SSLv3

	#   SSL Cipher Suite:
	#   List the ciphers that the client is permitted to negotiate.
	#   See the mod_ssl documentation for a complete list.
	#
        #   formerly, this was set to the following:
	#   ### SSLCipherSuite ALL:!ADH:!EXPORT56:RC4+RSA:+HIGH:+MEDIUM:+LOW:+SSLv2:+EXP:+eNULL
	#
	#   We now disable weak ciphers by default.
	#   Please see the documentation via the links above, and

	#
	# The following default should work with openssl running in FIPS
	# mode.
	#    OPENSSL_FORCE_FIPS_MODE=1 rcapache2 restart
	# will start the web server with FIPS mode in openssl.
	# For more information, please have a look at

	# package.
	SSLCipherSuite ALL:!aNULL:!eNULL:!SSLv2:!LOW:!EXP:!MD5:@STRENGTH

	#   Server Certificate:
	#   Point SSLCertificateFile at a PEM encoded certificate.  If
	#   the certificate is encrypted, then you will be prompted for a
	#   pass phrase.  Note that a kill -HUP will prompt again.  Keep
	#   in mind that if you have both an RSA and a DSA certificate you

	#SSLCertificateFile /etc/apache2/ssl.crt/server-dsa.crt

	#   Server Private Key:

	SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/apache2/ssl.key/linuxbase.key
	#SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/apache2/ssl.key/server-dsa.key

	#   Server Certificate Chain:
	#   Point SSLCertificateChainFile at a file containing the
	#   concatenation of PEM encoded CA certificates which form the
	#   certificate chain for the server certificate. Alternatively
	#   the referenced file can be the same as SSLCertificateFile
	#   when the CA certificates are directly appended to the server
	#   certificate for convinience.
	SSLCertificateChainFile /etc/apache2/ssl.crt/linuxbase-sf_bundle.pem

	#   Certificate Authority (CA):
	#   Set the CA certificate verification path where to find CA
	#   certificates for client authentication or alternatively one
	#   huge file containing all of them (file must be PEM encoded)
	#   Note: Inside SSLCACertificatePath you need hash symlinks
	#         to point to the certificate files. Use the provided
	#         Makefile to update the hash symlinks after changes.
	#SSLCACertificatePath /etc/apache2/ssl.crt
	#SSLCACertificateFile /etc/apache2/ssl.crt/ca-bundle.crt

	#   Certificate Revocation Lists (CRL):
	#   Set the CA revocation path where to find CA CRLs for client
	#   authentication or alternatively one huge file containing all
	#   of them (file must be PEM encoded)
	#   Note: Inside SSLCARevocationPath you need hash symlinks
	#         to point to the certificate files. Use the provided

	#SSLCARevocationPath /etc/apache2/ssl.crl
	#SSLCARevocationFile /etc/apache2/ssl.crl/ca-bundle.crl

	#   Client Authentication (Type):
	#   Client certificate verification type and depth.  Types are
	#   none, optional, require and optional_no_ca.  Depth is a
	#   number which specifies how deeply to verify the certificate
	#   issuer chain before deciding the certificate is not valid.
	#SSLVerifyClient require
	#SSLVerifyDepth  10

	#   Access Control:
	#   With SSLRequire you can do per-directory access control based
	#   on arbitrary complex boolean expressions containing server
	#   variable checks and other lookup directives.  The syntax is a
	#   mixture between C and Perl.  See the mod_ssl documentation
	#   for more details.

	#</Location>

	#   SSL Engine Options:
	#   Set various options for the SSL engine.
	#   o FakeBasicAuth:
	#     Translate the client X.509 into a Basic Authorisation.  This means that
	#     the standard Auth/DBMAuth methods can be used for access control.  The
	#     user name is the `one line' version of the client's X.509 certificate.
	#     Note that no password is obtained from the user. Every entry in the user
	#     file needs this password: `xxj31ZMTZzkVA'.
	#   o ExportCertData:
	#     This exports two additional environment variables: SSL_CLIENT_CERT and
	#     SSL_SERVER_CERT. These contain the PEM-encoded certificates of the
	#     server (always existing) and the client (only existing when client
	#     authentication is used). This can be used to import the certificates
	#     into CGI scripts.
	#   o StdEnvVars:
	#     This exports the standard SSL/TLS related `SSL_*' environment variables.
	#     Per default this exportation is switched off for performance reasons,
	#     because the extraction step is an expensive operation and is usually
	#     useless for serving static content. So one usually enables the
	#     exportation for CGI and SSI requests only.
	#   o CompatEnvVars:
	#     This exports obsolete environment variables for backward compatibility
	#     to Apache-SSL 1.x, mod_ssl 2.0.x, Sioux 1.0 and Stronghold 2.x. Use this
	#     to provide compatibility to existing CGI scripts.
	#   o StrictRequire:
	#     This denies access when "SSLRequireSSL" or "SSLRequire" applied even
	#     under a "Satisfy any" situation, i.e. when it applies access is denied
	#     and no other module can change it.
	#   o OptRenegotiate:
	#     This enables optimized SSL connection renegotiation handling when SSL
	#     directives are used in per-directory context.

	#   SSL Protocol Adjustments:
	#   The safe and default but still SSL/TLS standard compliant shutdown
	#   approach is that mod_ssl sends the close notify alert but doesn't wait for
	#   the close notify alert from client. When you need a different shutdown
	#   approach you can use one of the following variables:
	#   o ssl-unclean-shutdown:
	#     This forces an unclean shutdown when the connection is closed, i.e. no
	#     SSL close notify alert is send or allowed to received.  This violates
	#     the SSL/TLS standard but is needed for some brain-dead browsers. Use
	#     this when you receive I/O errors because of the standard approach where
	#     mod_ssl sends the close notify alert.
	#   o ssl-accurate-shutdown:
	#     This forces an accurate shutdown when the connection is closed, i.e. a
	#     SSL close notify alert is send and mod_ssl waits for the close notify
	#     alert of the client. This is 100% SSL/TLS standard compliant, but in
	#     practice often causes hanging connections with brain-dead browsers. Use
	#     this only for browsers where you know that their SSL implementation
	#     works correctly. 
	#   Notice: Most problems of broken clients are also related to the HTTP
	#   keep-alive facility, so you usually additionally want to disable
	#   keep-alive for those clients, too. Use variable "nokeepalive" for this.
	#   Similarly, one has to force some clients to use HTTP/1.0 to workaround
	#   their broken HTTP/1.1 implementation. Use variables "downgrade-1.0" and
	#   "force-response-1.0" for this.
	#   remark: The below configuration snippet is here for illustration purposes.
	#           Browser specific deficiencies exist, but generally all of them
	#           should handle SSL/TLS encapsulated connections well.
	#SetEnvIf User-Agent ".*MSIE.*" \
	#	 nokeepalive ssl-unclean-shutdown \
	#	 downgrade-1.0 force-response-1.0

	#   Per-Server Logging:
	#   The home of a custom SSL log file. Use this when you want a
	#   compact non-error SSL logfile on a virtual host basis.
	#CustomLog /var/log/apache2/ssl_request_log   ssl_combined
