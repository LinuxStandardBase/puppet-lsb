Puppet Configuration for LSB Infrastructure
===========================================

This repository contains (most of) the configuration for the LSB's
infrastructure.  We are moving to a devops model, where all server
configuration is done here instead of logging into a server and
munging configuration files.

We use Puppet (http://puppetlabs.com) as the configuration tool.  The
initial work done here was done with Puppet 2.6, and should remain
compatible with that version for the foreseeable future.

Configuration is defined per-service in Puppet modules, and per-node
in the "nodes" directory.  Whenever possible, it's best to define
services as modules, rather than include all the gory details in the
per-node config.  This makes it easy to move services between nodes; a
quick "include 'foo'" creates the service on the node and gets it
working.

The configuration will, in general, reflect a SUSE bias, as the
initial node was a SLES 11 virtual machine.  However, we are trying to
isolate SUSE-specific things as much as possible, so we should be able
to accomodate nodes running other Linux distributions as well.  This
will obviously not be foolproof, so sticking with SUSE may be the best
bet for making things work well.  Although we're using SLES, OpenSUSE
should also work.

Please test configuration changes on a test node before pushing them
into production!

Please file bugs related to our configuration at the LSB bug tracker
(http://bugs.linuxbase.org), in the Infrastructure section.  There is
a DevOps component; this should be used only for bugs or request
specifically aimed at Puppet itself.  Bugs in other components that
happen to be configured in Puppet should be filed in that component,
not in DevOps.  Patches or bzr merge directives against this
repository are welcome to bugs in any Infrastructure component.

Adding a node to Puppet
-----------------------

Adding a node to this Puppet configuration is pretty much standard
Puppet, with only a few tweaks required for our local setup:

 - Check out the puppet-lsb repository from version control.

 - In puppet-lsb, create a node configuration file in manifest/nodes.
   You can use one of the other node configuration files as a model.
   It can be blank between the initial braces of the "node" line, like
   this:

   node 'my.host.name' {}

   The filename can be descriptive, but the actual node name in the
   file must resolve to the IP address of the node.

 - Once the node file is in place, use version control to add the new
   file, commit it, and push it.

 - On the node, install puppet, and run the following command as root:

   puppet agent --server puppet.linuxbase.org --waitforcert 60 --test

   Puppet should report that it is creating a new key and cert request
   and that the peer certificate won't be verified.  It should then
   wait, reporting every so often that it can't receive the
   certificate.

 - On the master, "puppet cert list" should report that a
   certification request exists for the node.  Run "puppet cert sign
   <hostname>" to sign the certificate.

 - On the node, the running puppet agent should report within 60
   seconds that it is caching the certificate, and should then
   retrieve and apply the node's configuration (if any) without
   further errors.

At this point, the agent can be set up to run in the background.
Running "puppet agent -t" on the node tests the connection, and also
can force the current configuration to apply immediately without
waiting for the normal agent update interval.
